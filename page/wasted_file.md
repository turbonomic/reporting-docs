    SELECT storage_name as "Datastore",
           path as "File Path",
           file_size_kb as "File Size",
           modification_time as "Last Modified Time"
      FROM wasted_file
     WHERE file_size_kb >= 0
       AND ARRAY[storage_oid]::text[] && Array['$storage_oid']::text[]
     ORDER BY 3 DESC
